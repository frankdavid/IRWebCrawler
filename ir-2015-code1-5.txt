Distinct urls: 5780
Exact duplicates: 1872

Methodology:
We process the content within elements matching #contentMain and .textList. If the amount of text retrieved this way is
not sufficient (the length is <10 characters), we consider the whole textual content on the page.

The application was compiled against scala version 2.11.7.
